## Introduction
**Ulangi** makes it easy for you to manage and create flash cards to learn languages. It comes with built-in dictionaries, translators, built-in TTS, image search engine and more. You can use different learning methods to memorize them, such as spaced repetition, writing, quiz... **Everything about Ulangi (mobile, server, add-on, etc) is hosted in this repository.** 

**Ulangi** is completely free thanks to **[Midterm App](https://midterm.app)**. We are going to use some technology from it to make the desktop version.
